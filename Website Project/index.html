            When people think of pirates they usually think of bearded men with a peg leg and maybe a parrot, or you think of
        Blackbeard, Barbarossa, and Calico Jack. Although most pirates throughout history have been men, we shouldn't forget
        about the women that were also notorious and feared pirates. Although piracy was a male dominated occupation there were still a small minority of female pirates. This website is dedicated to some of the infamous badass 
        she-pirates of the seven seas that were recognized by historians.The pirates that will be talked about will be conentrated with female pirates of the 18th century since that was considered the Golden Age of Piracy.
