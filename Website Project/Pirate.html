    Ching Shih is considered to be one of the fiercest and most powerful pirate in human history. In ten years her pirate armada of around four hundred Chinese ships and several thousand men sailed down the coast of Imperial China, and ransacked and destroyed towns, killing and collecting money. Her fleet called the "Red Flag Fleet" enjoyed a lot of financial and military success mostly due to the ruthlessness of Captain Ching Shih.

    Not much is known of Ching Shih's early life, the first historical records of her are as a Chinese prostitute that became the wife of Cheng I, who was also a famous pirate captain at the time. As his wife she lived on his pirate fleet and helped her husband increase the size of his fleets. She didnt rise to power until the death of her husband where she inherited all of his ships and crew. She helped increase the number of ships and crew as captains and at her peak her fleet was 1,500 ships and a crew of 80,000 and basically controlled the waters of the South China Sea.
