    Rachel Wall is considered to be one of the frist American female pirates and the last woman to be hanged in Massachusets. Originally born as Rachel Schmidt in Pennsylvania, she grew up on a farm as a child but prefered the waterfront. After being attacked by a group of girls a man name George Wall resued her and the two fell inlove, and married. Once married to George Wall he persuaded her into joining him and the five sailors he had.

    Rachel and her crew sailed around the Isle of Shoals which was right off the coast of New Hampshire. She was known to stand on deck screaming for help after storms, and when people came to help her, they'd be killed and robbed. Rachel and her crew captured two boats, and stole around $6,000 in cash, and had a large amount of valuables as well. They also killed twenty-four sailors, and all of this happened in just one year. Eventually after her husband and crew were washed out to sea by an accident, Rachel returned to Bostona and tried to live the role as a servant. Although she stilled enjoyed going to the waterfront and stealing things. Her last robbery was from a young woman named Margaret, Rachel she tried to steal her bonnet and rip her tounge out but was caught and arrested. On September 10th, 1789 she was tried as a pirate but was found guilty of robbery and was sentenced to be hanged on October 8th.
