    Anne Bonny and Mary Read were cross-dressing pirates that ended up becoming one of the most fiercest female pirates of the Golden Age of Piracy in the 18th century. Although there are many stories of their adventures together as pirates the most famous one would be that they both defeated Calico Jack. 
    The two of them overpowered the crew and Jack which resulted in him surrending. The men ended up rotting in prision after that waiting for their sentences, while Anne and Mary got away by telling the privateers that they were pregnant and 
    were given a stay of execution. Anne Bonny and Mary Read's legacy lived on and marked their place in history as the two most famous female pirates ever known, and inspired many female pirates.
